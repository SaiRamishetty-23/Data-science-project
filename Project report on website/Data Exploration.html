<H3>Summary</H3>
<p>A variety of graphs are produced to explore the dataset's statistics. The first five pie charts will explore the composition of top five players and what type of points
helped them to score more. Later on, we will explore possible factors that can contribute to more total number of points for a player.</p>

<p><b>Explanation</b></p>
<p>The percentage of 2P goal points was generally the highest. Even if it was lower than the percentage 
of 3P points, the margin is not the same when percentage of 2P points is higher. For example, the 
percentage margin between 2P points and 3P points in player one’s points composition is 34.76% 
while it is 15.31% in player two’s points composition. Even in top 4 player’s composition, the 
percentage margin between 3P and 2P is 9.87% . Interestingly, the % of 3P goals is less in 3 out of 5 
player’s points, but this can be explained since many players do not score more 3P goals than 2P 
goals. The percentage of Free throws was never the highest in any pie chart, despite having higher 
number of throws. In conclusion, if a player wants to score more points, they should at least aim for 
a decent number of 2P goals.</p>

<H3>Factors that could contribute to more number of points</H3>
<div class="aligned"><img id=scplot1 src="images/scatterplot1.png">
<span>As it can be seen in this scatterplot, there is no 
correlation between Age and total points of a 
player. All data points are all rather vertically 
scattered, therefore, there is no linear 
relationship. Therefore, the age of a player does 
not really affect the total points of a player.</span></div>
<div class="aligned"><img id=scplot2 src="images/scatterplot2.png">
<span>The scatterplot here shows a positive linear 
relationship. Even though there are outliers 
present, the increase in number of steals means 
higher total points for a player. This shows that if a 
player makes more attempts to steal from the 
opposite player, it is guaranteed to generate more 
points, irrespective of whether it is 2P or 3P goal 
points. Therefore, a player must aim to make 
decent number of steals for more points.</span></div>
<div class="aligned"><img id=scplot3 src="images/scatterplot3.png">
<span>This scatterplot was rather surprising among 
other graphs. Generally, if a player makes a greater 
number of personal fouls, the chances to score 
higher points reduces. But in this case, we can see 
an overall positive linear relationship. Therefore, it 
can be concluded that making more personal fouls 
does not reduce chances of a player to score more 
points. It rather depends on the skill of the player.</span></div>
<div class="aligned"><img id=scplot4 src="images/scatterplot4.png">
<span>As expected, there is a positive linear 
relationship between number of field goal 
attempts and total points. This is because when a 
player tries, there is a chance to score a goal and 
win points. It does not really depend on the type 
of the goal, as long as the player keeps on trying 
to make more attempts to score a goal. 
Therefore, players must make more field goal 
attempts to score higher points.</span></div>
<div class="aligned"><img id=hist src="images/histogram.png">
<span>The histogram here clearly shows that a player in 
position SG scored the highest points among other 
players. However, it must be observed that PG has 
a higher range of players scoring from 0 to 1000 
points in comparison to SG, which is slightly below 
1000 points. Therefore, it is more likely for a player 
to score more points if positioned at PG. Both PG-SG and SF-PF had less data, therefore, it is not 
correct to make analysis on those positions.</span></div>
