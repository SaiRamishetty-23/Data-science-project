<H1>Data Preparation</H1>
<div class=exp1>
<H3>Summary</H3>
<p>During Data Preparation, I encountered errors like typos, impossible values, redundant white spaces, 
letter-case problems and missing values. Outliers were identified too, but as the values were valid 
and no strong evidence was there to remove them, they were kept.</p>
<H3 id=error>Errors detected</H3>
<p><b>1.Typos</b></p>
<p>I used the function “value_counts()” to see the position and team names. There were plenty of 
typos, such as names with wrong spelling(for example SGa and SF. , which is supposed to be SG and 
SF). To remove these errors, I identified the correct name for these typos and replaced them using 
the function “replace()”. To justify this replacement, I checked how many values each name had. For 
example, HOU had 18 values in the data, which is a high number and therefore, it is reasonable to 
assume H0U(the middle part of the name is zero, not O!) is the same as HOU.</p>
<p><b>2.Impossible values</b></p>
<p>I used if and else statements to identify any impossible value. For example, an NBA player has to be 
minimum age of 19 years old while the possible highest age is 120 years. After executing the 
program, I found two errors. Similarly, I found another error in the Points age column, which is a 
player’s points exceeding 2000 points. For fixing the error in Age, I checked the values count to see 
whether replacing the errors with the values in the data was reasonable. For example, one 
impossible error in Age was -19, but since there was a significant number of players with 19 years, it 
was justified to replace it. For points, there is a formula to calculate the total points(which is 
3*number of 3P goals + 2*number of 2P goals + number of FT(Free throws)). This was used to 
calculate the real points and these values were used to replace the impossible errors. In this column, 
the error 20000 was replaced by 2(0*3 + 1*2 + 0*1 = 2).</p>
<p><b>3.Redudant white spaces </b><p>
<p> Along with typos, these errors were identified too. All redundant white spaces were removed with 
the function “str.strip()”. For example, there were 3 errors which had “ PG”, but after the strip, it 
ended up as “PG” and they got added to “PG”.</p>
<p><b>4.Letter-case problem</b><p>
<p>This too was identified along with typos and redundant white spaces. Similarly, to typos, the value of 
each name in the column was checked to see if they can replace the errors. For example, to replace 
the error “pg”, I checked the number of positions with “PG”. Since there was a significant number of 
positions with PG, I replaced “pg” with “PG” using the “replace()” function.</p>
<p><b>5.Missing Values</b><p>
<p>Interestingly, the columns which had null values or missing values was the percentage columns. To 
detect whether there were null values, I used an if statement inside the for loop and “isnan()” 
function to check which value was empty. The way to fix this was checking the values of the field 
goals and field goal attempts. For example, I checked the values of 3P and 3PA for the null values in 
3P%. I came to know that both 3P and 3PA had zeroes. This was reflected in other field goal and field 
goal attempts columns as well. The formula to calculate 3P% is 3P/3PA, so, 0/0= 0. Therefore, I 
replaced all null values with zero using the function “fillna()”.</p>
